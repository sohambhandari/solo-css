<!--An element with a fixed position is positioned relative to the browser window,
 and will not move even if the window is scrolled.
The position can be specified using one or more of the properties top, right, bottom, and left. 



A relative positioned element is positioned relative to its normal position.
The properties top, right, bottom, and left can be used to specify how the rendered box will be shifted. -->
